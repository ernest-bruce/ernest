the company now called Meta actively and purposely violates these values:  
– facts  
– transparency 
– honesty  
– human_rights  
– safety  
– security  
– privacy  

Meta also violates its own published principles (https://about.facebook.com/company-info) 
regularly:  
– "serve everyone": violated every·time the company chooses to·profit from misinformation and 
the endangerment of the lives of young, vulnerable women  
– "build connection and community": Meta creates fissures within society, which grow into 
chasms that are impossible to·cross   
– "keep people safe and protect privacy": the companys behavior, like ignoring internal 
research, show that it doesnt care about the safety of its productized users and doesnt intend 
to·protect their privacy

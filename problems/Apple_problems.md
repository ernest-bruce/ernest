# Apple problems


iOS 15.2.1  
– sometimes phone doesnt sleep after 5 minutes (12022.01.18)  


macOS 10.15.7  
– i keep getting this message:  
![](apple/safari_plug·in_update_notifier.png)  
&nbsp;

· my 2012 MacBook is not getting major macOS updates, so this problem will remain with me  
· restarting will probably eliminate this symptom, but shit!  


Books.app and macOS·Catalina making trouble  
– after i closed the dialog, Books quit (or got quitted)   
– what is the fucking operation that caused this breakdown?  
· i was just sitting here watching YouTube videos and drinking tea  
· i used Books several hours ago to look at a book in my library  
· what did Books do to make macOS declare, “no, you dont”?  
· shit, let me look at recent log entries (within the last 30 minutes) in Console before they go away; i love diving into logs; theres nothing better  
· yes, there are better things to do with ones time, but now this is my focus    
– goddammit!  
· Console doesnt let me save anything!  
– i got it!  
· i packaged the evidence as a wonderful memory:

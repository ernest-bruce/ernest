&nbsp;

this is a repository of my  
– principles (values and ideals)  
– goals  
– northstar  

it also identifies entities and their public actions and behavior, which play a role in the 
level of trust that i asign to them  

my motivation is to systematize and semiautomate decisions about  
– who i follow, who i associate with, who i avoid  
– who i trust (and how much), who i do not trust  

for example, although not yet an identified entity, i choose to avoid [Dell](https://www.dell.com/en-us)  
· its CEO made disparaging comments about **Steve Jobs** and his decision to return to 
[Apple](https://www.apple.com)  
· so, im not getting a Dell, ever  

clone this repository to have the best experience viewing the content i post  
– view RTF and RTFD files in a viewer capable of rendering that content 
(its viewing experience on GitHub is not great)  
· for now, RTF and RTFD are the formats on which i can publish EverLang content effectively  
· i need to work on an EverLang editor that can write EverLang content and a viewer that can 
interpret and render that content effectively  
· the MD files contain unrendered EverLang from content in RTF and RTFD files

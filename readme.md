&nbsp;

this is a repository of my  
– principles (values and ideals)  
– goals  
– nortstar  
– entities and their public actions and behavior, which play a role in the level of trust that i
asign to them  

my motivation is to systematize and semiautomate decisions about  
– who i follow, who i associate with, who i avoid  
– who i trust (and how much), who i do not trust  

clone this repo to have the best experience viewing the content i post  
– view RTF and RTFD files in a viewer capable of rendering that content 
(its viewing experience on GitHub is not great)  
· for now, RTF and RTFD are the formats on which i can publish EverLang content effectively  
· i need to work on an EverLang editor that can write EverLang content and a viewer that can 
interpret and render that content effectively  
· the MD files contain unrendered EverLang from coontent in RTF and RTFD files

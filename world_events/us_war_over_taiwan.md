should the United States go to war with China over Taiwan?  
– how about the US establishing strong relationships with Central America and South America?  
· would resources be better used ensuring the progress and wellbeing of countries that are physically closer to the US?  
· would it be better to ensure that the American continent can make the products needed to explore earth and other planets?  
· do we really want to get into another war, with China this time?  
· yes, Taiwan could be a big loss, but maybe a bigger gain would be creating the biggest economic and political block on earth  
– the countries in South Africa (aka, “shithole countries”) may also present an great economic opportunity  
· we dont need more expensive wars  
· we need peaceful, productive relationships with neglected countries in trouble  
· if the US is serious about protecting people like the Uyghurs, it could ensure that China does not spread its genocide worldwide  
– what is the US vision?  
· what are its values?  
· different administrations have very different visions  
· i see no coherent strategy for treating countries as allies instead of tools for economic domination  
· US policies need to follow a single vision, no matter the adinistrations politics
